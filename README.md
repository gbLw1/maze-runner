# Maze Runner

This is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points in a maze. The maze is represented as a matrix of '#' and ' ' characters, where '#' represents a wall and ' ' represents an empty space. The algorithm uses the A\* search algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and end points in the maze.
