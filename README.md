# Maze Runner

## Description

This is a pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two points in a maze. The maze is represented as a matrix of '#' and ' ' characters, where '#' represents a wall and ' ' represents an empty space. The algorithm uses the A\* search algorithm to find the shortest path between the start and end points in the maze.

## Installation (Windows only)

If you're on Windows, you might need to install the `curse` library manually. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the program and display the maze on the screen. You can see the pathfinding algorithm in action due to the sleep function that slows down the algorithm.
